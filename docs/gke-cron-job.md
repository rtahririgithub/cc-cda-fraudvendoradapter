## GKE Cron Job
CronJobs create Kubernetes Jobs on a repeating schedule. CronJobs allow you to automate regular tasks like making backups, creating reports, sending emails, or cleanup tasks.   
In some cases, you may need to schedule a job to invoke a web api provided by your GKE workloads. For this reason, 
we have provided a [sample GKE Cron Job](sample-cron-job.yaml) that you can use for scheduling such operations.
